                <p class="fontv3">Your 7-day Sugar Detox was much more than a quick-fix diet; it was a journey of personal discovery.
Sugar is an excellent example of how processed foods can sabotage healthy eating, and during the
detox you empowered yourself with knowledge and practical experience that can help you transform
your diet for better health and vitality.</p>
<p class="fontv3">Now that you have finished you can be more flexible with your diet. The World Health Organization
(WHO) recommend that refined sugars contribute less than 5% of your total daily energy intake, which
is about 6-7 teaspoons of sugar for adults or about 3-4 teaspoons for children. Importantly, this is a
maximum level, so it is best to consume as little added sugar as possible. 
</p><p class="fontv3">If you want to use sweeteners we recommend healthier options such raw honey, maple syrup (not
maple flavoured syrup), coconut sugar, xylitol, stevia leaf, blackstrap molasses, 100% fruit jam and
dates or date syrup. They are better for your blood sugar and have nutritional benefits beyond their
sweetness.</p>
